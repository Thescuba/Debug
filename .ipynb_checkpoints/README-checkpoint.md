    * When using window's snipping tools to take notes for my classes I would load images into my notebooks and these work without any errors. When uploading them to github none of my images would load. It took some time but I found that snipping tool was saving the files at .PNG while I was typing them as .png. The remote repo really cared about the difference.




# Notebooks Installation

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks to follow along with the lectures. However, there are several
packages and applications that need to be installed. It is recommended to install anaconda at (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Alternatively you may just want to go with just a python 3 install and use pip to install numpy, matplotlib, pandas nad jupyterlab or notebook.

## Install Git

Follow the instructions at (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


## Run Notebooks

1. Clone the repository to a desired location (E.g. `git clone https://github.com/Thescuba/data-science.git`)
2. Open up jupyter labs or jupyter notebook either though anaconda navigator or terminal. 
3. Go to the repository directory
