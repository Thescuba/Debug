We can be in 2 states either the <code>tag</code> or <code>not tag</code> mode. We can only add a character if we are not in tag mode and the character is a not <code><</code> else we would be moved to tag mode. In the other case where were are in tag mode if the character is <code>></code> we keave to no tag mode but in all other cases we stay in tag mode. Now let see if we can put this into code"
